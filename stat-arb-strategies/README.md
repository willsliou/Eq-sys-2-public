Statistical Arbitrage techniques:

1. Pair trading: A strategy that involves identifying two related assets that tend to move in tandem, and then trading the divergence in their prices.

2. Mean reversion: A strategy that involves identifying assets that have deviated significantly from their historical mean, and then trading the expected return to the mean.

3. Correlation trading: A strategy that involves trading based on the correlation between two or more assets.

4. Principal component analysis: A technique used to identify latent factors that drive the behavior of a group of assets, and then using those factors to identify trading opportunities.

5. Machine learning: A more advanced technique that involves using machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and relationships between financial assets, and then using those patterns to make trades.
